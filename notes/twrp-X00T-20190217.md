## Notes for F2FS-supported TWRP, February 17 build

* This is now based on Redmi Note 5 AI/Pro (whyred) [official TWRP tree](https://github.com/TeamWin/android_device_xiaomi_whyred) instead of on [shakalaca's](https://github.com/shakalaca/android_device_asus_X00T).
* The recovery is compatible with both 3/4 GB variants (with Novatek NT36672) and 6 GB variant (with Synaptics DSX v2.7) of ZenFone Max Pro (M1) aka X00T.
* My version of TWRP has dropped dependencies on FUSE modules, replaced by kernel implementations:
  * ntfs-3g / tntfs (stock module) -> NTFS support in kernel
  * exfat-fuse / texfat (stock module) -> sdFAT (reimplementation by Samsung)
  * Although unrelated to FUSE: vfat -> sdFAT (better support)
* This version onwards will use modified stock-based kernel that has enabled and upstreamed F2FS.
* f2fs-tools included in the recovery has been updated to be based on 'few revisions behind' AOSP master with devel branch merged into.
* The recovery is built from android-9.0 branch with various additions from LineageTWRP project plus small patches from myself to fix several code errors, particularly things that affect ALL aspects of formatting scenario.
* USB-OTG should work, since it's now an Oreo kernel.
* Don't ask for kernel upstream, since it's not really important on TWRP.
* However, despite my effort, decryption doesn't work and I don't have much time dealing with this issue since X00T is my primary device.
