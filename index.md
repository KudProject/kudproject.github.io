## About

KudProject is a solo project that was started in March 2016 with KudTW for Galaxy J2 LTE (j2lte), which later renamed to KudKernel in later releases before discontinued shortly after due to lack of actual device and testers. KudKernel was also available for Galaxy S4 GT-I9500 (ja3gxx, previously i9500), also to have it discontinued sooner.
